The `Comment` model represents a comment that a user can post on a specific post. It includes fields to associate each comment with a user and a post, as well as timestamp fields to track when the comment was created and last updated.

```python
from django.db import models 
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from posts.models import Post

class Comment(models.Model):
   
    owner = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    post = models.ForeignKey(Post, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    content = models.TextField()

    class Meta:
        ordering = ['-created_at']

    def __str__(self):
        return self.content
```

- **Fields**:
  - `owner`: Foreign key to the `User` model, representing the user who owns the comment.
  - `post`: Foreign key to the `Post` model, representing the post that the comment belongs to.
  - `created_at`: Timestamp for when the comment was created.
  - `updated_at`: Timestamp for when the comment was last updated.
  - `content`: Text content of the comment.

- **Meta Options**:
  - `ordering`: Comments are ordered by `created_at` in descending order.

    created_at = serializers.SerializerMethodField()
    updated_at = serializers.SerializerMethodField()

    def get_is_owner(self, obj):
        request = self.context['request']
        return request.user == obj.owner

    def get_created_at(self, obj):
        return naturaltime(obj.created_at)

    def get_updated_at(self, obj):
        return naturaltime(obj.updated_at)

### `ProductList`
The `ProductList` view lists all products or allows authenticated users to create a new product.

```python
from rest_framework import generics, permissions
from .models import Product, Category
from .serializers import ProductSerializer, CategorySerializer
from drf_api.permissions import IsOwnerOrReadOnly

class ProductList(generics.ListCreateAPIView):
    permission_classes = [permissions.IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly]

```

- **Attributes**:
  - **permission_classes**: Allows any user to view products but restricts creation to authenticated users.
  - **queryset**: Defines the base queryset for all products.
  - **serializer_class**: Specifies the serializer for `Product`.
 
### `ProductDetail`
The `ProductDetail` view retrieves, updates, or deletes a product instance, restricting these actions to the product owner.

```python

class ProductDetail(generics.RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView):
    permission_classes = [IsOwnerOrReadOnly]
    queryset = Product.objects.all()
    serializer_class = ProductSerializer

```

- **Attributes**:
  - **permission_classes**: Restricts update and delete actions to the product owner.
  - **queryset**: Base queryset for products.
  - **serializer_class**: Specifies the serializer for `Product`.
 
### `CategoryList`
The `CategoryList` view lists all categories or allows admins to create a new category.

```python

class CategoryList(generics.ListCreateAPIView):
    permission_classes = [permissions.IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly]
    queryset = Category.objects.all()
    serializer_class = CategorySerializer

```

- **Attributes:**

  - **permission_classes**: Allows updating or deleting by admin users only.
  - **queryset**: Base queryset for categories.
  - **serializer_class**: Specifies the serializer for `Category`.
 
## URLs
Defines URL patterns for accessing product and category views.

```python
from django.urls import path
from .views import ProductList, ProductDetail, CategoryList, CategoryDetail

urlpatterns = [
    path('products/', ProductList.as_view(), name='product-list'),
    path('products/<int:pk>/', ProductDetail.as_view(), name='product-detail'),
    path('categories/', CategoryList.as_view(), name='category-list'),
    path('categories/<int:pk>/', CategoryDetail.as_view(), name='category-detail'),
]

```

- **`products/`**: Lists all products or allows authenticated users to create a product.
- **`products/<int:pk>/`**: Retrieves, updates, or deletes a specific product by ID.
- **`categories/`**: Lists all categories or allows only admins to create a category.
- **`categories/<int:pk>/`**: Retrieves, updates, or deletes a specific category by ID (admin only)

### Products App Structure

In the **Products App**, there are two main models: `Product` and `Category`. While the `Product` model allows users to create and manage individual product recommendations, the `Category` model is designed for administrative use. Categories are part of the `products` app rather than a separate app, which provides clear organization for product-related models and ensures easier management within the same app structure.

- **Category**: Used exclusively to categorize products within the `products` app. Only admins have permission to create, update, or delete categories. This design helps maintain a controlled environment for product categorization, ensuring that categories remain consistent and relevant to the platform‚Äôs scope.

```python
from django.db import models
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class Profile(models.Model):
    owner = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
